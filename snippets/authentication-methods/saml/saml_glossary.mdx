| **Assertion**                        | A statement issued by the Identity Provider (IdP) containing authentication, attribute, and authorization data about a user, used by the Service Provider (SP) to authenticate the user.                                                                                           |
| **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS)** | The endpoint on the Service Provider (SP) that receives the SAML response containing the assertion from the Identity Provider (IdP) and processes it for user authentication.                                                                                                      |
| **Attribute**                        | A piece of information about the user that the Identity Provider (IdP) sends to the Service Provider (SP) within a SAML assertion, such as user roles or group memberships.                                                                                                        |
| **AttributeStatement**               | A part of the SAML assertion containing user attributes, such as email address, roles, or group memberships, sent from the Identity Provider (IdP) to the Service Provider (SP).                                                                                                   |
| **Entity ID**                        | The Entity ID is a globally unique string assigned to either an Identity Provider (IdP) or a Service Provider (SP). This identifier helps to differentiate different entities in a SAML federation and ensures that the communication is happening between the correct IdP and SP. |
| **Identity Provider (IdP)**          | An entity that authenticates users and issues SAML assertions to Service Providers (SPs) for Single Sign-On (SSO).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **IdP-initiated Flow**               | An authentication flow where the user starts at the Identity Provider (IdP), which sends a SAML response directly to the Service Provider (SP), granting the user access.                                                                                                          |
| **Metadata**                         | A file that describes the configuration of the Identity Provider (IdP) or Service Provider (SP), including URLs, certificates, and supported bindings.                                                                                                                             |
| **SAML Request**                     | A request message from the Service Provider (SP) to the Identity Provider (IdP) to initiate authentication, including requests for specific authentication context or user attributes.                                                                                             |
| **SAML Response**                    | A message from the Identity Provider (IdP) to the Service Provider (SP) that contains the SAML assertion, which includes authentication information about the user.                                                                                                                |
| **Service Provider (SP)**            | An entity that provides services or resources to users and relies on an Identity Provider (IdP) to authenticate users via SAML assertions.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Single Logout (SLO)**              | A mechanism by which a user can log out from all connected systems and service providers in a federated environment with one logout action.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**             | A method of authentication that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. SAML is commonly used to implement SSO.                                                                                                                            |
| **SP-initiated Flow**                | An authentication flow where the Service Provider (SP) initiates the authentication request to the Identity Provider (IdP), common when the user accesses a service directly.                                                                                                      |
| **Unsolicited SAML Request**         | A request sent by the Identity Provider (IdP) to the Service Provider (SP) without the SP first initiating the request. This typically occurs in an IdP-initiated SSO flow.                                                                                                        |                                |
