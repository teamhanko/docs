<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Is Hanko open source?">
Yes, Hanko is open source and all source code is published in the Hanko monorepo on GitHub. Hanko backend is licensed under AGPLv3 and the Hanko Frontend SDK as well as Hanko Elements are MIT licensed. Please note that the Hanko Cloud infrastructure and the Hanko Cloud Console are closed source.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Hanko Cloud?">
  Hanko Cloud provides a hosted Hanko backend, simplifying the initiation and
  management of new Hanko projects. It comes with out-of-the-box user management
  and analytics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I self-host Hanko?">
  Yes, you can self-host. Please refer to this
  [guide](https://github.com/teamhanko/hanko/tree/main/backend#hanko-backend).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I get my data out of Hanko Cloud?">
  You can access most of your data via the Admin API. This data does not include password hashes or TOTP secrets. If you need these as well, please contact us and we will provide a complete dataset for migrating to self-hosted Hanko or another authentication provider.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I integrate Hanko to my app?">
  Check out our [quickstart guides](/quickstarts/fullstack/next) to help you
  integrate Hanko with your favorite frameworks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I integrate Hanko to a mobile app?">
  Yes, you can. However, we currently do not have SDKs for Swift, Kotlin, React
  Native, or Flutter. These are on our roadmap for future development. In the
  meantime, you can make your mobile client work directly with the Hanko API,
  but it's a bit more work on your end.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Hanko to add passkeys to my existing authentication solution?">
  Yes, we provide a dedicated product for that: The Hanko Passkey API. Refer to our [Passkey API docs](/passkey-api/introduction) for more
  information.
