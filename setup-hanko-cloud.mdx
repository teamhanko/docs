When using Hanko for your app's authentication, the easiest way is to do that is by utilizing Hanko Cloud infrastructure where we host the Hanko backend for you. You can set up and manage your Hanko projects via the Hanko Cloud Console. 

Here's a quick video guide to get started with Hanko Cloud:

## Setting up your Hanko Cloud project:

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign up to Hanko Cloud">
    To begin, head over to Hanko Cloud and [create a new account](https://cloud.hanko.io/signup). If you already have an account, just [log in](https://cloud.hanko.io/login).

</Step>
<Step title="Set up your organization">
    Once you've signed up, you'll be directed to create an organization. You can change the organization's name later, so don't worry too much about it at this point.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a new project">
    With your organization set, it's time to kick off a new Hanko Cloud project. Choose 'Authentication and user management' and click on 'Continue'. Of course you can also select 'Passkey API' if that's what you want, but be aware that the remainder of this guide is specific for setting up Hanko projects.

    Enter your project name and your app's full URL. For the app URL, include `http://` or `https://` and, if running locally, the port number (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You can change both values later.
