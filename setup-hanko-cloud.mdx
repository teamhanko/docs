### Follow these 5 quick steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign up to Hanko Cloud">
    To begin, head over to Hanko Cloud and [create a new account](https://cloud.hanko.io/signup). If you already have an account, just [log in](https://cloud.hanko.io/login).

</Step>
<Step title="Set up your organization">
    Once you've signed up, you'll be directed to create an organization. You can change the organization's name later, so don't worry too much about it at this point.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a new project">
    With your organization set, it's time to kick off a new Hanko Cloud project. Choose 'Authentication and user management' and click on 'Continue'.

    Enter your project name and your app's full URL. For the app URL, include `http://` or `https://` and, if running locally, the port number (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You can change both values later.

<Step title="Copy the API URL">
