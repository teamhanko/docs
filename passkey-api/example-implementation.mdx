title: Example Implementation
description: Without using any SDKs, just raw HTTP, how would you use the Passkey API?
---

This is an example implementation showing how to use the Passkey API with Node.js. (You can use any language you want to, of course!)

However, if you're already using JavaScript/TypeScript for your backend, you can use [\@teamhanko/passkeys-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/passkeys-sdk), which do all of the below for you.

Otherwise, please make sure to always send JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`.

As of writing, for the frontend, the Web Authentication API expects you to pass `ArrayBuffer` (instead of plain old objects) in a lot of places, which can be inconvenient.

In the examples below we're using [@github/webauthn-json](https://github.com/github/webauthn-json#githubwebauthn-json) which is a wrapper around the Web Authentication API to make things easier

1. **Get your tenant ID**

   The base URL for the Passkey API depends on your `tenant_id`.

   You can [find your tenant ID in your Hanko Cloud account.](https://cloud.hanko.io/organizations)

   [👉 Explanation for tenant ID](/passkey-api/faq#tenant-id-and-multitenancy)

   If you self-host the Passkey API, there are endpoints that let you create, list, and manage tenants programmatically. [See the API reference](https://github.com/teamhanko/passkey-server/tree/main/spec)

   &nbsp;

2. **Add endpoints to start and finish passkey registration**

   Registering passkeys is a two-step process. First, let's add an endpoint to our backend. This example uses Express.js, but you can use whatever language or framework you prefer.

   **Backend:**

   ```jsx
   const tenantId = process.env.PASSKEY_TENANT_ID;
   if (!tenantId) throw new Error("Missing PASSKEY_TENANT_ID");

   const apiKey = process.env.PASSKEY_SECRET_API_KEY;
   if (!apiKey) throw new Error("Missing PASSKEY_SECRET_API_KEY");

   const baseUrl = `https://passkeys.hanko.io/${tenantId}`;
   const headers = { apiKey, "Content-Type": "application/json" };

   app.post("/passkey/start-registration", async (req, res) => {
     // Remember: to register a passkey, the user needs to be logged in first.
     //           Once the passkey is added to the user's account, they can
     //           use it to log in.

     // This is the currently logged in user:
     const user = req.session.user;

     // Send the id and name of the user stored in our DB.
     // (both fields are required)
     const creationOptions = await fetch(baseUrl + "/registration/initialize", {
       method: "POST",
       headers,
       body: JSON.stringify({
         user_id: user.id.toString(), // Must be a string!
         username: user.username,
       }),
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // creationOptions is an object that can directly be passed to create()
     // (the function that opens the "create passkey" dialog)
     // in the frontend.
     res.json(creationOptions);
   });

   app.post("/passkey/finalize-registration", async (req, res) => {
     const data = await fetch(baseUrl + "/registration/finalize", {
       method: "POST",
       headers,
       body: JSON.stringify(req.body), // Forward newly created credential
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // The response from the Passkey API contains a JWT (`data.token`).
     // What you do with this JWT is up to you.
     //
     //
     // The JWT contains 4 claims:
     // "sub": the user_id we used for "/registration/initialize".
     //        you can use this to issue a session for the user, for example
     //
     // "cred": the credential_id (ID of the passkey the user chose)
     //
     // "aud": an array with a single string.
     //        the string is the ID of the relying party (your app).
     //        e.g. ["example.com"]
     //
     // "iat": the expiration date (very short)
     //
     //
     // Here, we don't need to do anything with it, since the user already
     // is logged in. In the login endpoints, later in this guide, we'll
     // use the data contained in the JWT to create a session for our user.

     res.redirect("/success");
   });
   ```

   **Frontend:**

   ```jsx
   import { create, get } from "@github/webauthn-json";

   async function registerPasskey() {
     // Let's send a request to our backend to start the registration process.
     // The response JSON can directly be passed to create(...) below.
     const creationOptions = await fetch("/passkey/start-registration", {
       method: "POST",
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // Open "create passkey" dialog
     const credential = await create(creationOptions);

     // User successfully created a passkey on their device.
     //
     // The resulting `credential` object needs to be sent back to the
     // Passkey API as-is, through our backend:
     //
     // frontend → backend → passkey API
     return fetch("/passkey/finalize-registration", {
       method: "POST",
       headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
       body: JSON.stringify(credential),
     });
   }
   ```

   Here's what the whole flow looks like:

   <Frame>
     <img src="/images/passkey-api/register-flow.png" />
   </Frame>

   As you can see, there's two steps here ("start" and "finalize"), which pass through the frontend, backend, and Passkey API.

   The process looks very similar for logging in &mdash; it's also a two-step process where your frontend, backend, and the Passkey API are involved.

3. **Add endpoints to start and finish logging in**

   Similar to how registering a passkey is a two-step process, so is logging in.

   **Backend:**

   ```jsx
   app.post("/passkey/start-login", async (req, res) => {
     const loginOptions = await fetch(baseUrl + "/login/initialize", {
       method: "POST",
       headers,
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // loginOptions is an object that can directly be passed to get()
     // (the function that opens the "select passkey" dialog)
     // in the frontend.
     res.json(loginOptions);
   });

   app.post("/passkey/finalize-login", async (req, res) => {
     const data = await fetch(baseUrl + "/login/finalize", {
       method: "POST",
       headers,
       body: JSON.stringify(req.body), // Credential the user selected
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // Like when registering, data.token is a JWT that contains claims
     // about the user (see above)

     res.redirect("/success");
   });
   ```

   **Frontend:**

   ```jsx
   async function loginWithPasskey() {
     const loginOptions = await fetch("/passkey/start-login", {
       method: "POST",
     }).then((res) => res.json());

     // Open "select passkey" dialog
     const credential = await get(loginOptions);

     // User selected a passkey to use.
     //
     // The returned `credential` object needs to be sent back to the
     // Passkey API as-is.
     return fetch("/passkey/finalize-login", {
       method: "POST",
       headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
       body: JSON.stringify(credential),
     });
   }
   ```

   Note that for logging in, the server can also talk to the Passkey API directly, instead of going through your backend first. Whether you go with the server-first or client-first approach is up to preference. See [Client-First Login Flow](/passkey-api/client-first-login-flow)
