# Hanko GitHub OAuth Integration Guide

**About Hanko**:
<HankoAbout />

**What This Guide Covers**: This guide demonstrates how to integrate GitHub OAuth authentication with Hanko, allowing users to sign in using their GitHub accounts. You'll learn to create a GitHub OAuth app, configure authentication settings, and implement GitHub login in your application.

**Key Technologies**: 
- OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol
- GitHub OAuth Apps and API
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management
- RESTful API integration
- Frontend SDK integration

**Prerequisites**: 
- Active Hanko Cloud account with a configured project
- GitHub account for developer access
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Frontend application ready for integration

**Tasks You'll Complete**:
1. Create and configure a GitHub OAuth application
2. Set up redirect URLs and obtain client credentials
3. Configure GitHub OAuth settings in Hanko Console
4. Implement GitHub authentication in your frontend application
5. Handle authentication success and error states

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain GitHub OAuth Credentials">

- First, obtain the redirect URL from [Hanko console](https://cloud.hanko.io/), as you'll need it for GitHub configuration. Sign in to Hanko and select your project. Navigate to 'Settings' in the left sidebar and then to 'Identity Providers'. Copy the 'Redirect URL' from here.

      alt="Hanko Callback URL"
      width={500}
    />

- Navigate to GitHub and click on your profile photo at the top right corner.
- Select 'Settings' at the bottom of the sidebar menu.
 
    <img
      src="/images/oauth-providers/github-settings.png"
      alt="GitHub settings option"
      width={500}
    />


- Scroll down and select 'Developer Settings' in the left sidebar.

        <img
          src="/images/oauth-providers/developer-settings.png"
          alt="GitHub Developer Settings"
          width={500}
         />

- Choose 'OAuth Apps' followed by 'New OAuth App'. This opens the registration form for creating your OAuth application.

    <img
      src="/images/oauth-providers/github-new-auth.png"
      alt="GitHub New OAuth App option"
      width={700}
    />

    <Note>
      The redirect URL is crucial. It guides GitHub on where to redirect users
      post-authentication. It's a blend of Hanko API's base URL and the
      /thirdparty/callback endpoint. The exact Hanko API base URL (and hence
      your redirect URL) hinges on your Hanko setup: whether you use Hanko Cloud
      or have a self-hosted Hanko API.
    </Note>

- Return to the OAuth app registration form, fill in the required details, and paste the copied redirect URL into the 'Application Callback URL' field. Complete the registration by clicking 'Register application'.

      src="/images/oauth-providers/github-oauth-form.png"
      alt="GitHub OAuth Registration Form"
      width={500}
    />

- You'll now see an overview of your OAuth app. Note down the provided 'Client ID'. Generate a 'Client Secret' by selecting 'Generate a new client secret'. Copy both values, as you'll need them in the next step.

      width={500}
    />
</Step>
<Step title="Configure GitHub Credentials with Hanko">

- Return to Identity providers in Hanko and under 'Identity provider settings' configure the following:
    <img
      src="/images/oauth-providers/hanko-callback-url.png"
      alt="Hanko Callback URL"
      width={500}
    />

    - **Error Redirect URL**: This URL, on your frontend, is where the Hanko API redirects if an error occurs during third-party sign-in. With hanko-elements web components, it should link to the page embedding the web component to process errors correctly.
    - **Allowed Redirect URL**: A URL on your frontend that the Hanko API can redirect to after a successful third-party authentication. Using hanko-elements web components? Make it the URL of the embedding page.

              <Note>
              Supports wildcard matching through globbing:
               - `https://*.example.com` matches `https://foo.example.com` and `https://bar.example.com`.
               - `https://foo.example.com/*` matches URLs like `https://foo.example.com/page1` and `https://foo.example.com/page2`.
               -  Use ** to act as a super-wildcard/match-all.
              </Note>

- In the 'Providers' section, select GitHub and enable its toggle switch.
- Input the earlier noted 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret', then click 'Save'.

</Step>

<Step title="Implement GitHub Login in Your Frontend Application">

Whether you choose to use the pre-designed UI from the `@teamhanko/hanko-elements` package or opt for a custom UI with the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` will determine your approach to frontend integration.

<Tabs>

<Tab title='Hanko Elements'>
- Integrate the `<hanko-auth>` component from `hanko-elements` based on our frontend guides. If everything is good, the component will display a button for signing in with 'Github' in login view.

    <Note>
    Make sure to configure the page the web component is embedded on as your error redirect URL as well as an allowed redirect URL.
    </Note>

    Post successful GitHub authentication, the backend sets a session cookie and errors during authentication are displayed within the component accordingly.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Hanko Frontend SDK">
- For a custom UI, initialize third party sign-in using `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk`.
- Create Hanko client instance and call `thirdParty.auth` with github as the provider.

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

        async function signInWithGitHub() {
        try {
            await hanko.thirdParty.auth("github", "<your_redirect_url>");
        } catch (error) {
            // handle error
        }
        }
        ```

- On successful authentication, the API redirects you to the given redirect URL. The URL query includes a one time token that must be exchanged for a JWT. Use the `token.validate` method on your client to validate the token:

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

        async function onLoad() {
        try {
            await hanko.token.validate();
        } catch (error) {
            // handle error
        }

        // you should now have a JWT cookie set
        }
        ```

        On success, the API issues a JWT which is then set by the SDK as a cookie (hanko). All other SDK methods can now use the cookie to make authenticated requests to the API.
