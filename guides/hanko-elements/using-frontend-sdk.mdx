description: The following examples will cover some common use-cases for the `hanko-frontend-sdk` instance returned by the `register()` function, but please take a look into the [frontend-sdk docs](https://teamhanko.github.io/hanko/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/) for details.
---

You can create a `hanko-frontend-sdk` instance without having to register the web components as follows

```js
import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-elements";
const hanko = new Hanko("YOUR_HANKO_API_URL");
```

## Events
It is possible to bind callbacks to different custom events in use of the SDKs event listener functions. The callback function will be called when the event happens and an object will be passed in, containing event details.

### Session created

Will be triggered after a session has been created and the user has completed possible additional steps (e.g. passkey
registration or password recovery). It will also be triggered when the user logs in via another browser window. The
event can be used to obtain the JWT.

```js
hanko.onSessionCreated(({ claims }) => {
  console.info("Session created with JWT claims:", claims);
    // Redirect to a protected page
});
```

### Session Expired

Will be triggered when the session has expired, or when the session has been removed in another browser window, because the user has logged out, or deleted the account.

```js
hanko.onSessionExpired(() => {
  console.log("Session expired, redirecting to login");
  // Redirect to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
});
```

### User Logged Out

Will be triggered, when the user actively logs out. In other browser windows, a "hanko-session-expired" event will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserLoggedOut(() => {
  console.log("User logged out successfully");
  // Redirect to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
});
```
### User Deleted

Will be triggered when the user has deleted the account. In other browser windows, a `hanko-session-expired` event will be triggered at the same time.

```js
hanko.onUserDeleted(() => {
  console.log("User account deleted");
  // Redirect to a login page or show the `<hanko-auth>` element.
});
```

## Sessions

Check if the user has a valid session:

```js
const session = await hanko.validateSession();
console.log("Session valid:", session.is_valid, "Claims:", session.claims);
```

Retrieve the session token:
```js
const token = hanko.getSessionToken();
console.log("Session token:", token);
````

## User Client 

The SDK includes client classes to simplify communication with the Hanko API. Here are some common operations:

### Getting the current user

```js
const user = await hanko.getUser();
console.log("User profile:", user.user_id, user.emails);
```

### Log out a user

```js
await hanko.logout();
console.log("User logged out");
```
