# Hanko Elements Events Component Guide

**About Hanko**: Hanko is a modern passwordless authentication solution that eliminates the need for traditional passwords by leveraging passkeys, biometrics, and other secure authentication methods. It provides a seamless, secure, and user-friendly authentication experience while reducing security risks associated with password-based systems.

**What This Guide Covers**: This guide demonstrates how to use the `<hanko-events>` web component, which provides a way to listen for authentication events without displaying any UI elements. You'll learn how to bind event handlers to respond to authentication state changes in your application.

**Key Technologies**: Hanko Elements, Web Components, JavaScript event handling, authentication events, frontend SDK integration, and event-driven architecture.

**Prerequisites**: Basic knowledge of JavaScript event handling, web components, and frontend development. Understanding of authentication flows and event-driven programming will be helpful.

**Tasks You'll Complete**: 
- Implement the `<hanko-events>` component in your application
- Bind event handlers to authentication events
- Handle session creation, expiration, and user state changes
- Integrate event handling with your application's navigation and state management
- Use events for custom authentication flows and user experience enhancements
</div>

<Info>
You can subscribe to events with the `<hanko-auth>` and `<hanko-profile>` components in the same way. You can also bind event handlers using the `frontend-sdk` (see the next section).
