1. **Gather SMTP server credentials** from your email provider. You'll need the following information:

   - Host (SMTP server address)
   - Port (typically 587 for TLS or 465 for SSL)
   - Username (often your email address)
   - Password (or API key for some providers)
   - Sender email address (must be verified with your provider)

   If you're using [Resend](https://resend.com), follow our detailed [tutorial](https://www.hanko.io/blog/send-hanko-auth-emails-from-your-domain-via-resend) for setup instructions.

2. **Access your project settings** by logging into [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and selecting your project.

3. **Navigate to email configuration** at `Settings > Email`.

4. **Configure your SMTP server** by enabling the Custom SMTP Server option, entering your credentials, and clicking `Save`.
