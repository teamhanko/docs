# Hanko Custom SMTP Guide

**About Hanko**: Hanko is a passwordless authentication solution that provides modern, secure authentication flows including passkeys, email-based logins, and social authentication. It offers both hosted (Hanko Cloud) and self-hosted options, with comprehensive SDKs for seamless integration.

- DNS Configuration
- Email Authentication (SPF, DKIM)

**Prerequisites**: 
- Hanko Pro or Enterprise plan subscription
- SMTP server credentials from your email provider
- Basic understanding of email server configuration
- Access to Hanko Cloud Console

**Tasks You'll Complete**:
1. Gather SMTP server credentials from your provider
2. Configure custom SMTP settings in Hanko Cloud
3. Test email delivery functionality
4. Verify email authentication and deliverability

1. **Gather SMTP server credentials** from your email provider. You'll need the following information:

   - Host (SMTP server address)
   - Port (typically 587 for TLS or 465 for SSL)
   - Username (often your email address)
   - Password (or API key for some providers)
   - Sender email address (must be verified with your provider)

   If you're using [Resend](https://resend.com), follow our detailed [tutorial](https://www.hanko.io/blog/send-hanko-auth-emails-from-your-domain-via-resend) for setup instructions.

2. **Access your project settings** by logging into [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and selecting your project.

3. **Navigate to email configuration** at `Settings > Email`.

4. **Configure your SMTP server** by enabling the Custom SMTP Server option, entering your credentials, and clicking `Save`.
