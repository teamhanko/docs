- Hanko Pro or Enterprise plan subscription
- Email service provider account
- Webhook endpoint development capability
- Basic understanding of email delivery systems
- JWT token processing knowledge

**Tasks You'll Complete**:
- Create webhook for email.send events
- Disable Hanko's default email delivery
- Process webhook payloads for email data

This guide walks you through implementing custom email delivery instead of using Hanko's default email service.

## Create a webhook

Set up a webhook subscription for the `email.send` event. This webhook triggers whenever Hanko needs to send an authentication email.

## Disable email delivery by Hanko

<ProFeatureNote/>

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Access email delivery settings"}>
        Log in to Hanko Cloud, select your organization and project, then navigate to `Settings > Email delivery`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Disable default email delivery"}>
        Set the `Email delivery` setting to `Off` to disable default email sending.
    </Step>
</Steps>

Once disabled, Hanko will no longer send emails for you. All email sending becomes your responsibility through webhook handling.

## Send custom emails

When Hanko needs to send an email, the `email.send` webhook event triggers with all necessary data for custom email delivery. The webhook token payload contains comprehensive email information:

import WebhookEmailSendExample from '/snippets/webhooks/email-send-example.mdx';
import WebhookEmailSendProperties from '/snippets/webhooks/email-send-properties.mdx';

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title={"'email.send' token payload example"} defaultOpen={true}>
        <WebhookEmailSendExample/>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title={"'email.send' token payload properties"}>
        <WebhookEmailSendProperties/>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The `data` property contains type-specific information for email personalization. This structure varies based on the email type being sent (verification, password reset, etc.).

Use the webhook data to compose and deliver emails through your preferred email service provider or custom infrastructure, giving you complete control over email design and delivery.
