## About webhooks

Webhooks enable real-time event subscriptions within your Hanko project, automatically delivering event data to your server whenever authentication events occur. This facilitates user data synchronization and custom workflow automation.

Create webhooks by specifying a callback URL and selecting events to monitor. When subscribed events occur, Hanko sends HTTP POST requests with event data to your specified endpoint. Your application can then process this data through a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint.

## Creating webhooks

Set up webhooks through these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Access webhook settings"}>
        Log in to [Hanko Cloud Console](https://cloud.hanko.io), select your organization and project, then navigate to
        `Settings > Webhooks`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Configure your webhook"}>
        Click `Create webhook`, enter your callback URL, and select events for subscription.
        Review [Events](#events) for complete event type information.
    </Step>
</Steps>

You can implement either a single webhook endpoint handling multiple events or separate webhooks for specific event types, depending on your architecture preferences.

## Handling webhook deliveries

Process webhook deliveries through these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Create callback endpoint"}>
        Implement a publicly accessible HTTP POST endpoint at your configured callback URL to receive webhook deliveries.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Parse webhook payload"}>
        Extract the webhook [event payload](#event-payload) containing event information and JWT-encoded event data.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Validate payload authenticity"}>
        Verify JWT signatures using your tenant's [.well-known](/api-reference/public/well-known/get-json-web-key-set) endpoint to ensure deliveries originate from Hanko and remain uncompromised.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Decode JWT token"}>
        Parse the JWT to extract event data from the token payload. Event data structures vary by event type - see [Event types and token payloads](#event-types-and-token-payloads).
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Process event data"}>
        Handle the extracted event data according to your application's specific requirements.
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Accordion title={"Example (Javascript)"}>

This example uses [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and the [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose)
package to parse and verify JWTs.

```shell
npm install express jose
```

The example assumes usage of a single HTTP endpoint for all event types but you could just as well configure
multiple webhooks and use multiple HTTP endpoints.

```javascript
// These are the dependencies you should have installed for
// this example.
const express = require('express');
const { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } = require('jose');

const app = express();

// Middleware for parsing requests with a JSON payload.
app.use(express.json());

// Step 1: This defines a POST endpoint at the `/webhook` path.
// This path should match the path portion of the URL that you
// specified for the callback URL when you created the webhook.
// Once you edit a webhook by updating the callback URL of your
// webhook, you should change this to match the path portion of
// the updated URL for your webhook.
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    // Step 2: Extract the event and token from the request body.
    // You could use the event type to branch and apply
    // logic/code for specific event types.
    // This example assumes one endpoint for all event types so
    // extracting the `event` property may lead to an unused
    // variable.
    const { event, token } = req.body;

    try {
        // This would likely come from your environment/config.
        // You can always find your tenant ID on the dashboard
        // for your project in the Hanko Cloud Console.
        const tenantId = 'your-tenant-id';

        // See also the API reference:
        // http://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/well-known/get-json-web-key-set
        const jwksUrl = `https://${tenantId}.hanko.io/.well-known/jwks.json`;

        // Step 3 + 4: Fetch the JWKS of your Hanko tenant, verify
        // the token signature using the JWKS and extract the
        // payload.
        const jwks = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(jwksUrl));
        const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, jwks);

        console.log('Decoded token payload:', payload);

        // Step 6: Do further processing according to your
        // application's needs.

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing the token:', error.message);
    }

    //  Your endpoint should respond with a 2XX response within 30 seconds
    //  of receiving a webhook delivery to indicate that the delivery was
    //  successfully received. If your server takes longer than that to
    //  respond, then Hanko terminates the connection and considers the
    //  delivery a failure.
    res.sendStatus(202);
});

// Start the Express server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

```

<Warning>
    Your server **must** return the complete certificate chain otherwise the request will fail.
</Warning>

## Editing and removing webhooks

Manage existing webhooks through these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Access webhook settings"}>
        Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io), select your organization and project, then navigate to
        `Settings > Webhooks`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Modify or delete webhooks"}>
        Find your webhook and click the three dots (`...`). Choose `Edit` to modify the callback URL or event subscriptions, or `Delete` to remove the webhook completely.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Events

Hanko offers various event types for subscription. Each event type determines the structure and content of the payload delivered to your callback URL.

### Event payload

The structure of the event payload is the same across all event types. It contains the event type and the event data in the form of a JSON Web
Token (JWT).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title={"Event payload example"}>
        ```json user.create
        {
            "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6...",
            "event": "user.create"
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title={"Event payload properties"}>
        <ResponseField name="token" type="string">
            The JWT that contains the actual webhook event data. It is a JSON Web Signature (JWS). Webhook recipients
            should verify the signature to ensure that the webhook deliveries were sent by Hanko and have not been
            tampered with.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="event" type="string">
            The event that triggered this webhook
        </ResponseField>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Event types and token payloads

Events are structured hierarchically with some events subsuming the occurrence of multiple ("sub")-events. These
types of events do not actually appear as the value for the `event` property in the webhook event payload. Subscribing
to these types of events when creating a webhook is a convenient way to group certain event types and allows you to
structure your callback endpoints around these groups.

A webhook's event data is encoded as a JWT in the webhook's callback request body. You need to parse the token
to access the token's payload which contains the actual event data (see
[Handling webhook deliveries](#handling-webhook-deliveries) for an example).
