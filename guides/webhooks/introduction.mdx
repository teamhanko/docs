## About webhooks

Webhooks allow you to subscribe to events within a Hanko project and automatically receive data deliveries to your
server/application whenever those events take place. This allows you to, for example, synchronize user data between your
application(s) and Hanko.

To create a webhook you specify a callback URL and subscribe to events that occur in your Hanko project. Once an
event that your webhook is subscribed to occurs, Hanko will send an HTTP POST request with data about the event to the
URL that you specified. If your application provides a publicly available HTTP endpoint listening for webhook deliveries
at the configured callback URL, it can react and process webhook data.

## Creating webhooks

To create a webhook:

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Access your project's webhook settings"}>
        Log in to the [Hanko Cloud Console](https://cloud.hanko.io), select your organization and project and navigate to
        `Settings > Webhooks`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Create a webhook"}>
        Click `Create webhook`. Enter a callback URL and select the events that you want to subscribe to.
        See [Events](#events) for more information on the events you can subscribe to.
    </Step>
</Steps>

You are free to choose whether you create a single webhook with one HTTP endpoint processing multiple events or
multiple webhooks with more than one HTTP endpoint handling specific events or event groups.

## Handling webhook deliveries

To handle webhook deliveries:

<Steps>
    <Step title={"Create callback URL endpoint"}>
        In order to handle webhook deliveries, your application must provide a publicly available HTTP POST endpoint
        listening for webhook deliveries at the configured callback URL.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Parse webhook payload"}>
        Once you have an endpoint set up you need to extract the webhook [event payload](#event-payload). It
        contains information about which event occurred and the actual event data encoded in a JSON Web Token (JWT).
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Validate webhook payload"}>
        To ensure that your application only processes webhook deliveries that were sent by Hanko and to ensure that
        the delivery has not been tampered with, you should validate the JWT's signature before processing the delivery
        further. You can use the JSON Web Key Set available through your tenant's
        [.well-known](/api-reference/public/well-known/get-json-web-key-set) endpoint to do so.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Parse webhook payload token"}>
        The JWT contained in the webhook payload must be parsed to obtain the event
        data from the token payload. The structure of the event data may differ from event type to event type.
        For more information, see [Event types and token payloads](#event-types-and-token-payloads).
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Process event data"}>
        Once you have extracted the event data from the token you can process it according to your application's needs.
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Accordion title={"Example (Javascript)"}>

This example uses [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and the [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose)
package to parse and verify JWTs.

```shell
npm install express jose
```

The example assumes usage of a single HTTP endpoint for all event types but you could just as well configure
multiple webhooks and use multiple HTTP endpoints.

```javascript
// These are the dependencies you should have installed for
// this example.
const express = require('express');
const { createRemoteJWKSet, jwtVerify } = require('jose');

const app = express();

// Middleware for parsing requests with a JSON payload.
app.use(express.json());

// Step 1: This defines a POST endpoint at the `/webhook` path.
// This path should match the path portion of the URL that you
// specified for the callback URL when you created the webhook.
// Once you edit a webhook by updating the callback URL of your
// webhook, you should change this to match the path portion of
// the updated URL for your webhook.
app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    // Step 2: Extract the event and token from the request body.
    // You could use the event type to branch and apply
    // logic/code for specific event types.
    // This example assumes one endpoint for all event types so
    // extracting the `event` property may lead to an unused
    // variable.
    const { event, token } = req.body;

    try {
        // This would likely come from your environment/config.
        // You can always find your tenant ID on the dashboard
        // for your project in the Hanko Cloud Console.
        const tenantId = 'your-tenant-id';

        // See also the API reference:
        // http://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/well-known/get-json-web-key-set
        const jwksUrl = `https://${tenantId}.hanko.io/.well-known/jwks.json`;

        // Step 3 + 4: Fetch the JWKS of your Hanko tenant, verify
        // the token signature using the JWKS and extract the
        // payload.
        const jwks = createRemoteJWKSet(new URL(jwksUrl));
        const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, jwks);

        console.log('Decoded token payload:', payload);

        // Step 6: Do further processing according to your
        // application's needs.

    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing the token:', error.message);
    }

    //  Your endpoint should respond with a 2XX response within 30 seconds
    //  of receiving a webhook delivery to indicate that the delivery was
    //  successfully received. If your server takes longer than that to
    //  respond, then Hanko terminates the connection and considers the
    //  delivery a failure.
    res.sendStatus(202);
});

// Start the Express server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

```

<Warning>
    Your server **must** return the complete certificate chain otherwise the request will fail.
</Warning>

## Editing/removing webhooks

You can edit or remove configured webhooks. To do so:

<Steps>
    <Step title={`Access your project's webhook settings`}>
        Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io), select your organization and project and navigate to
        `Settings > Webhooks`.
    </Step>
    <Step title={"Edit/delete a webhook"}>
        Locate the desired webhook and click on the three dots (`...`). Select `Edit` to change either the callback URL
        of the webhook or the events to subscribe to. Select `Delete` to remove the webhook entirely.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Events

There are different types of events you can subscribe to. The event type determines the contents of the event payload
(i.e. the body content of the request to your callback URL in response to an event occurrence).

### Event payload

The structure of the event payload is the same across all event types. It contains the event type and the event data in the form of a JSON Web
Token (JWT).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title={"Event payload example"}>
        ```json user.create
        {
            "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6...",
            "event": "user.create"
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title={"Event payload properties"}>
        <ResponseField name="token" type="string">
            The JWT that contains the actual webhook event data. It is a JSON Web Signature (JWS). Webhook recipients
            should verify the signature to ensure that the webhook deliveries were sent by Hanko and have not been
            tampered with.
        </ResponseField>

        <ResponseField name="event" type="boolean">
            The event that triggered this webhook
        </ResponseField>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Event types and token payloads

Events are structured hierarchically with some events subsuming the occurrence of multiple ("sub")-events. These
types of events do not actually appear as the value for the `event` property in the webhook event payload. Subscribing
to these types of events when creating a webhook is a convenient way to group certain event types and allows you to
structure your callback endpoints around these groups.

A webhook's event data is encoded as a JWT in the webhook's callback request body. You need to parse the token
to access the token's payload which contains the actual event data (see
[Handling webhook deliveries](#handling-webhook-deliveries) for an example).
