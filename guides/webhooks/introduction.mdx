Webhooks are an easy way to get informed about changes in your Hanko instance (e.g. user or email updates).
To use webhooks you have to provide an endpoint on your application which can process the events. Please be aware that your
endpoint need to respond with an HTTP status code 200. Else-wise the delivery of the event will not be counted as successful.

<Warning>
    Your server **must** return the complete certificate chain otherwise the request will fail.
</Warning>

## Events
When a webhook is triggered it will send you a **JSON** body which contains the event and a jwt.
The JWT contains 2 custom claims:

* **data**: contains the whole object for which the change was made. (e.g.: the whole user object when an email or user is changed/created/deleted)
* **evt**: the event for which the webhook was triggered

A typical webhook event looks like:

```json
{
  "token": "the-jwt-token-which-contains-the-data",
  "event": "name of the event"
}
```

## Event Types

Hanko sends webhooks for the following event types:

| Event                       | Triggers on                                                                                                                        |

As you can see, events can have subevents. You are able to filter which events you want to receive by either selecting
a parent event when you want to receive all subevents or selecting specific subevents.

## Restrictions

Due to security concerns there are some usage restrictions for webhooks in place:

* A webhook will be disabled after 30 days without usage. In this scenario usage describes the successful triggering of events
<Note>This mechanism can be disabled by setting `webhooks.allow_time_expiration` to `false`</Note>

* A webhook will also be disabled when our trigger mechanism is not successful. The mechanism will try 5 attempts of sending events before disabling a webhook. A trigger is unsuccessful when:
  * your callback URL is not reachable due to network errors or a wrong url
  * your webhook endpoint returns HTTP Status codes >= 400

The restrictions are not available for webhooks defined in the config file.

## Data

When a webhook is triggered it will send you a **JSON** body which contains the event and a jwt.
The JWT contains 2 custom claims:
* **data**: contains the whole object for which the change was made. (e.g.: the whole user object when an email or user is changed/created/deleted)
* **evt**: the event for which the webhook was triggered
