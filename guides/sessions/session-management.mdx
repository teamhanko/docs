## Sessions and JSON Web Tokens

A session is created when a user authenticates with Hanko (either by registering a new account or by signing in to
an account). The session is represented by a JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).
JWTs encode claims about subjects (users) as JSON objects. They can also include a signature, in which case their
structure is that of a JSON Web Signature ([JWS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515)). All JWTs issued by
Hanko are signed JWSs.

API operations that establish a session (login, registration) return a session token in an `X-Auth-Token`
header.

<Note>
    When using [Hanko Elements](https://docs.hanko.io/guides/hanko-elements/introduction) or
    the [Hanko Frontend SDK](https://docs.hanko.io/resources/sdks#sdks), the session token is read from the
    `X-Auth-Token` header and used to set a cookie (name: `hanko`) on the client-side. If you use neither Hanko
    Elements nor the SDK, you have to take care of storing the session token yourself.
</Note>

Subsequent requests to protected API endpoints must then provide the session token in a `Cookie` request header
or alternatively in an `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`).

## Stateless vs. stateful sessions

Sessions can be configured as either stateless or stateful (server-side) sessions.

- <u>**Stateless**</u>: with stateless sessions, a session JWT is generated that contains claims about the user. For
all future requests to protected endpoints, the API validates the JWT's expiry and signature  (see
[below](#session-jwt-structure) for details on the JWT structure).
- <u>**Stateful**</u> (default): with stateful sessions, a JWT is generated in the same way but session validation
makes use of a unique identifier that is generated, persisted in the database
alongside its association to a user, and stored in the session JWT under the `session_id` claim. For all future requests,
the Hanko API validates the JWT signature and uses the `session_id` to query the database for a matching active session.
Stateful sessions have the benefit of allowing for remote session revocation. This means that if a user is logged in
on one device but also has multiple sessions across other devices, the API's
[Profile](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/flow/profile) flow allows listing and explicitly terminating the session
on those devices. This feature is also reflected in the UI provided by the Hanko
Elements' [Profile Component](https://docs.hanko.io/guides/hanko-elements/profile-component).

To configure the desired session type:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Server side sessions`, toggle the desired session type and click `Save`.

## Session validation

JWTs should be parsed and its claims and signature validated to ensure the token is authentic and has not been tampered
with or has expired.

### Validating stateless sessions

The JWT token signature is generated using the RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256) algorithm. It is an asymmetric
algorithm, that uses a public/private key pair. The private key is kept secret and stored by the Hanko API. It is
used to create the token's signature.
The public key, a JSON Web Key ([JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517)), is published through the Hanko
API's `.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint as part of a JSON Web Key Set
([JWKS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#section-5)). To validate the JWT:

1. Fetch the JWKS from the`.well-known/jwks.json`
[endpoint](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/well-known/get-json-web-key-set).
2. Parse and validate the JWT using the JWKS. We recommend using a web framework middleware (if you are using one) or
a third-party library instead of parsing and validating the token yourself. Use a library that supports the
aforementioned signing algorithm (RS256).

<Accordion title="Third-party library JWK set support">
    Some libraries contain convenience functions for fetching remote or local JWK Sets and using the result of this
    operation as an optional argument in their central verification functions
    (e.g. the JavaScript [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose) package's
    [createRemoteJWKSet](https://github.com/panva/jose/blob/main/docs/jwks/remote/functions/createRemoteJWKSet.md#examples)
    , see [this guide](https://docs.hanko.io/quickstarts/backend/node#express) for an example of its
    usage for validating a stateless session token). If the library of your choice does not support this, you have to match
    the `kid` property in the [header](#jwt-header) of your session token with the `kid` of a JWK contained in the fetched JWK Set and use the matching
    JWK to verify the token (see [this](https://docs.hanko.io/quickstarts/backend/rust) guide for an example).
</Accordion>

### Validating stateful sessions

With stateful sessions you can instead use the `sessions/validate`
[endpoint](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/session-management/validate-a-session-1)
to validate the session. You need to provide the session token in the request body. The endpoint validates the token's
expiry and signature and ensures that the encoded `session_id` matches a persisted session.

The session endpoint returns an object that contains information about the validity of a session, the
session token's expiry as well as the ID of the user the session is associated with. The latter allows you to later retrieve
additional user information through [public](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/user-management/get-a-user-by-id)
or [administrative](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/admin/user-management/get-a-user-by-id) user management
endpoints.

## Session termination

Depending on configuration, there multiple ways of (explicitly or implicitly) terminating a session.

### Explicit user logout

A user can explicitly request a logout. This requires a request to the `/users/logout`
[endpoint](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/user-management/log-out-the-current-user).
A successful request clears session cookies and, if stateful sessions are enabled, terminates the session associated
with the session token.

### Limiting session duration

Sessions can be terminated (or: become invalid) by exceeding an expiry. This expiry can be configured by setting the
session duration. Session duration determines how long a user remains logged in after authenticating.
By default, the session duration is set to 12 hours in the Hanko Cloud Console.
You can change this to a value between 1 minute and 1 month to suit your application's needs.

To change the session duration, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Session duration`, set the desired session duration and click `Save`.

### Limiting concurrent session

Sessions can also be (implicitly) terminated by exceeding the number of allowed active sessions. By default,
Hanko allows 5 concurrent sessions. If a user establishes another session, then the oldest session becomes
invalid.

<Note>
    Stateful (server-side) sessions must be enabled (see:
    [Stateless vs. stateful sessions](#stateless-vs-stateful-sessions)) to configure concurrent session limits.
</Note>

To configure the allowed amount of concurrent sessions:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Session limit`, enter the desired amount and click `Save`.


## Session JWT structure

The session JWT is a [compact](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-3.1) JWS. It is a string composed
of three base64 URL safe encoded parts ([header](#jwt-header), [payload](#jwt-payload) and signature), separated by a
dot (`.`). The JWT payload contains the claims about a user.

### JWT Header

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "2288bfa9-3214-4f19-9757-92631190420b",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

<ResponseField name="alg" type="string">
    The algorithm used for signing this token.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="kid" type="string">
    The key ID indicating which key was used to secure the token.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="typ" type="string">
    The media type of this token.

### JWT Payload

<ResponseField name="aud" type="string[]">
    The audience for which the JWT was created. It specifies the intended recipient or system that should accept this

            A boolean field indicating whether the email address is the primary email. Currently, this field is
            redundant because only the primary email is included in the JWT.
        </ResponseField>
