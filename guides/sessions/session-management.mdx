## Sessions and JSON Web Tokens

A session is created when a user authenticates with Hanko (either by registering a new account or by signing in to
an account). The session is represented by a JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).
JWTs encode claims about subjects (users) as JSON objects. They can also include a signature, in which case their
structure is that of a JSON Web Signature ([JWS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515)). All JWTs issued by
Hanko are signed JWSs.

API operations that establish a session (login, registration) return a session token in an `X-Auth-Token`
header.

<Note>
    When using [Hanko Elements](https://docs.hanko.io/guides/hanko-elements/introduction) or
    the [Hanko Frontend SDK](https://docs.hanko.io/resources/sdks#sdks), the session token is read from the
    `X-Auth-Token` header and used to set a cookie (name: `hanko`) on the client-side. If you use neither Hanko
    Elements nor the SDK, you have to take care of storing the session token yourself.
</Note>

Subsequent requests to protected API endpoints must then provide the session token in a `Cookie` request header
or alternatively in an `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme (i.e. `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`).

Upon session creation, a unique identifier is generated and stored in the database, linked to the corresponding user.
This identifier is also included in the session JWT under the `session_id` claim. For subsequent requests, the API
validates the JWT signature and uses the `session_id` to query the database for an active session match. This enables
remote session revocation. As a result, if a user is logged in on one device but has multiple active sessions across
other devices, the API’s [Profile](/api-reference/flow/profile) flow facilitates the listing and
explicit termination of sessions on those devices. This functionality is also accessible through the UI via the Hanko
Elements’ [Profile Component](/guides/hanko-elements/profile-component).

## Session validation

To manually validate a session you can use the API's  `sessions/validate` [endpoint](/api-reference/public/session-management/validate-a-session-1).
You need to provide the session token in the request body. The endpoint validates the token's
expiry and signature and ensures that the encoded `session_id` matches a persisted session.

The session endpoint returns an object that contains information about the validity of a session, the
session token's expiry as well as claims about the user the session is associated with.

You can also use the Hanko Frontend SDK to check for session validity. See
[Using the Frontend SDK](/guides/hanko-elements/using-frontend-sdk#sessions) for details.

## Session termination

Depending on your tenant's configuration, there are various methods available for explicitly or implicitly terminating
a session.

### Explicit user logout

A user can explicitly request a logout. This requires a request to the `/users/logout`
[endpoint](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/public/user-management/log-out-the-current-user).
A successful request clears session cookies and terminates the session associated with the session token.

### Limiting session duration

Sessions can be terminated (or: become invalid) by exceeding an expiry. This expiry can be configured by setting the
session duration. The session duration determines how long a user remains logged in after authenticating.
By default, the session duration is set to 12 hours in the Hanko Cloud Console.
You can change this to a value between 1 minute and 1 month to suit your application's needs.

To change the session duration, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Session duration`, set the desired session duration and click `Save`.

### Limiting concurrent session

Sessions can also be (implicitly) terminated by exceeding the number of allowed active sessions. By default,
Hanko allows 5 concurrent sessions. If a user establishes another session, then the oldest session becomes
invalid.

To configure the allowed amount of concurrent sessions:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Session limit`, enter the desired amount and click `Save`.

### Limiting cookie retention period

You can configure the retention period of session cookies. Possible configurations are:

- **Persistent** (default): This type sets the `Max-Age` attribute of the cookie to the specified
[session duration](#limiting-session-duration) (in seconds). The cookie will be automatically deleted from the browser
once the specified expiry time has been reached.
- **Session**: This type sets the `Max-Age` attribute of the cookie to 0, resulting in the cookie being deleted from the
browser when the browser tab or window is closed.
- **Prompt**: If you use [Hanko Elements](/guides/hanko-elements/introduction) (+1.3) then selecting this type results
in Hanko Elements displaying a `Stay signed in` checkbox on the login form which allows users to determine the cookie
retention period: if the checkbox is checked, the cookie will be a `Persistent` cookie, if it is unchecked the
cookie will be a `Session` cookie.

To configure the cookie retention period:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Under `Stay signed in (cookie type)`, select the desired type and click `Save`.

## Session self-service

There are a number of configurations options for your tenant that provide control over how users manage their session
through the profile.

### Allowing session revocation

You can configure whether the [Profile](https://docs.hanko.io/api-reference/flow/profile) flow permits session
revocation via the dedicated `session_delete` action. If you are using
[Hanko Elements](/guides/hanko-elements/introduction) version 1.3 or later, the Profile component provides interface
elements that allow users to revoke active sessions, excluding the session currently in use.
This session can be revoked manually through a [manual logout](#explicit-user-logout).

To control self-service session revocation behaviour:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Use the `Allow session revocation` toggle to allow or disallow end-user session revocation via profile.

### Showing sessions on profile

You can control whether information about active sessions is returned in the `Profile` flow.
If you use [Hanko Elements](/guides/hanko-elements/introduction) (+1.3) then information about active sessions is
displayed in the [Profile component](guides/hanko-elements/profile-component).

To control whether information about active sessions is returned from the `Profile` flow (and shown in Hanko Elements):

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Use the `Show sessions on profile` toggle to include information about active sessions in the profil API response
(and the [Hanko Elements profile component](guides/hanko-elements/profile-component)).

## Session metadata retention

You can control whether active session metadata is persisted with a session and returned from session validation
[endpoints](/api-reference/public/session-management/validate-a-session). This metadata currently includes the IP
address and the user agent used to establish a session.

To control the type of metadata retained with a session:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. You can configure the following options:
     -  Use the `Acquire IP address` toggle to include information about the IP (IPv4/IPv6) address used to establish
        the session.
     -  Use the `Acquire user agent` toggle to include information about the user agent used to establish the session.

## Session callbacks

You can hook into the session lifecycle by using the Hanko Frontend SDKs central client. See
[Using the Frontend SDK](/guides/hanko-elements/using-frontend-sdk#events) for details.

## Administrative session management

The [Admin API](/api-reference/admin/introduction#learn-how-to-use-the-hanko-admin-api) allows administrators to
[create sessions](/api-reference/admin/session-management/create-session),
[list active sessions](/api-reference/admin/session-management/list-sessions) and
[delete sessions](/api-reference/admin/session-management/delete-session) for a specific user.

## Session token customization

Session tokens can be extended with custom claims by defining them using
[Go's text/template syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). These claims are evaluated during JWT generation and
may include static values, dynamic expressions, or nested structures.

To define custom claims:

1. Log in to [Hanko Cloud](https://cloud.hanko.io) and select your project.
2. Navigate to `Settings > Session`.
3. Locate the `Customize session token` section.
4. Enter your custom claims in YAML format within the provided textarea.
5. Click `Save` to apply your changes.

### Accessing user data in templates

Each template has access to user data via the `.User` field, which includes:
- `.User.UserID`: The user's unique ID (string)
- `.User.Email`: Email details (optional)
    - `.User.Email.Address`: The email address (string)
    - `.User.Email.IsPrimary`: Indicates if the email is the primary address (boolean)
    - `.User.Email.IsVerified`: Indicates if the email is verified (boolean)
- `.User.Username`: The user's username (string, optional)

### Example configuration

```yaml
role: "user"                               # Static value
user_email: "{{.User.Email.Address}}"      # Templated string
is_verified: "{{.User.Email.IsVerified}}"  # Boolean from user data
metadata:                                  # Nested map
  source: "hanko"
  greeting: "Hello {{.User.Username}}"
scopes:                                    # Slice with templated value
    - "read"
    - "write"
    - "{{if .User.Email.IsVerified}}admin{{else}}basic{{end}}"
```

### Important notes and limitations

- Custom claims are added at the top level of the session token [payload](#jwt-payload).
- Claims with the following keys will be ignored because they are currently added to the JWT by default:
    - `sub`
    - `iat`
    - `exp`
    - `aud`
    - `iss`
    - `email`
    - `username`
    - `session_id`
- Templates must conform to valid [Go text/template syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). Invalid templates are
logged and excluded from the generated token.
- Boolean strings ("true" or "false") from templates are automatically converted to actual booleans.
The `.User.Email` object itself currently does not serialize accurately as a JSON object in the JWT payload. It is
recommended to access specific fields (Address, IsVerified, IsPrimary) or construct custom representations using Go
template expressions.

## Session JWT structure

The session JWT is a [compact](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515#section-3.1) JWS. It is a string composed
of three base64 URL safe encoded parts ([header](#jwt-header), [payload](#jwt-payload) and signature), separated by a
dot (`.`). The JWT payload contains the claims about a user.

### JWT Header

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
