description: In this guide you will learn how to add a login with Microsoft to your application.
---

## Prerequisites

1. You need a Hanko Cloud account and a project. Learn more on how to set them up [here](https://docs.hanko.io/setup-hanko-cloud).
2. You need a Microsoft Azure account. You can create account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Get your provider redirect URL

When creating an Azure Application, you need to provide a redirect URL that determines where the third party
provider redirects after a successful login. This redirect URL consists of the base URL of the Hanko API
and the [`/thirdparty/callback`](http://docs.hanko.io/api/public#tag/Third-Party/operation/thirdPartyCallback) endpoint. You can always view your redirect URL in the Hanko Cloud Console:

1. Sign in to [cloud.hanko.io](https://cloud.hanko.io).
2. Select your `Organization`.
3. Select your `Project`.
4. In the left sidebar, click `Settings`, then select `Identity providers`.
5. Find your redirect URL in the `Redirect URL` input.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/hanko-callback-url.png"
        alt="Hanko Callback URL"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

You need the redirect URL for [creating a new Azure application](#create-a-new-azure-application) in the next step and when
[configuring your credentials with Hanko](#configure-credentials-with-hanko) (you will also configure the remaining
configuration options visible in the above screen in this step).

## Create a new Azure application

1. Navigate to and log in to the [Azure portal](portal.azure.com).
2. Click the hamburger menu in the navbar in the top left.
3. Select `Microsoft Entra ID`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/dashboard.png"
        alt="Access Microsoft Entra ID"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

4. Select `App registrations` in the left sidebar.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/entra-app-registrations.png"
        alt="Access app registrations"
        width={150}
    />
</Frame>

5. On the top left, click on `New registration`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/new-registration.png"
        alt="Request new app registration"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

6. Enter your Application name.
7. Under `Supported account types` choose the 3rd option i.e `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`.
    <Warning>
        The above option allows any user to login to your application. Other account types (single-tenant only,
        multi-tenant or public only) are currently not supported.
    </Warning>
8. Under the `Redirect URI` section select `Web` as the platform.
9. Enter the `Redirect URL` you obtained in the [first step](#get-your-provider-redirect-url) as the value.
10. Click on `Register`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/app-registration.png"
        alt="Fill app registration form"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

## Get your client ID and secret

Next, you need to obtain your client ID and client secret.

1. You can view the client ID of your app in the `Essentials` section on the `Overview` page (`Application (client) ID`)
of your application/app registration.
You will need this when [configuring your credentials with Hanko](#configure-credentials-with-hanko)

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/view-client-id.png"
        alt="View client ID"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

2. To create a client secret, select `Certificates & Secrets` in the sidebar.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/certificates-and-secrets.png"
        alt="View app certificates and secrets"
        width={150}
    />
</Frame>

3. Select the `Client secrets` tab.

<Warning>
    Hanko currently does not support using `Certificates`.
</Warning>

4. Select `New client secret`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/new-client-secret.png"
        alt="Request new client secret"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

5. Give your secret a name.
6. Select an expiration date.

<Warning>
    Hanko Cloud currently does not provide any means to auto-rotate secrets, so keep the expiration date of your
    secret in mind and manually refresh the secret when necessary.
</Warning>

7. Click `Add` to create the secret.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/configure-client-secret.png"
        alt="Configure new client secret"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

8. After creating the secret, make sure to copy the secret `Value`. You will need this when
[configuring your credentials with Hanko](#configure-credentials-with-hanko).

<Note>
    You can no longer copy the `Value` of the secret after a full page refresh. If you you forget to do so, simply
    create another secret and remove the old one.
</Note>

## Token configuration

Next, we recommend making some additional adjustments to the claims containend in the tokens handed out by Microsoft.

### Add UPN claim

It is possible that users do not have a primary email address set but Hanko requires email addresses to create
accounts. To ensure Hanko is provided with an email address, set the optional `upn`
([UserPrincipalName](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/plan-connect-userprincipalname#upn-format))
claim. In general, the `upn` domain suffix cannot be changed to an unverified domain and hence the `upn` will be
prioritized over a users' `email` (see the [next section](#protection-against-the-noauth-vulnerbility)). To configure
the claim:

1. Select your app registration and then select the `Token configuration` section.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/token-configuration.png"
        alt="View app token configuration"
        width={150}
    />
</Frame>

2. Select `Add optional claim`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/add-optional-claim.png"
        alt="Add new optional token claim"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

3. Select `ID` as the token type.
4. Tick the `upn` checkbox to select it as an additional optional claim.
5. Click `Add`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/configure-optional-claim.png"
        alt="Configure optional claim"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

6. Tick the checkbox to set the required Microsoft Graph permissions.
7. Click `Add`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/set-graph-permissions.png"
        alt="Set Microsoft Graph permissions for the upn claim"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

### Protection against the nOAuth vulnerability

In 2023 Descope [discovered](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth) a vulnerability resulting
from misconfigurations of multi-tenant apps that could potentially lead to account takeovers when linking
accounts with the provider (account linking is activated by default in Hanko). To mitigate this
vulnerability Microsoft provides the following guidance:

1. Configure the `authenticationBehaviors` setting of your application to disallow unverified email domains. This should
be the default case for newly created applications, so no further steps should be required.

<Info>
    If your application was created before the publication of the vulnerability, and the application previously used
    unverified emails, you might need to manually alter the `authenticationBehaviours` as described
    [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/migrate-off-email-claim-authorization#how-do-i-protect-my-application-immediately).
</Info>

2. Use the optional `xms_edov` token claim to check if an email domain owner has been verified. We recommend implementing
this additional security measure in case the tokens do not contain a `upn` (e.g. if the claim has not been configured
or the configuration has been reverted) and decisions have to be based on a users' `email` property. To do so, first open
your applications `Manifest`.

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/microsoft/manifest.png"
        alt="View app manifest"
        width={150}
    />
</Frame>

3. Find the `optionalClaims` key and set its value to the following (make a backup of the manifest file, just in case):

```json
"optionalClaims": {
		"idToken": [
			{
				"name": "xms_edov",
				"source": null,
				"essential": false,
				"additionalProperties": []
			}
		]
	}
```

<Info>
    You may notice that after adding the `xms_edov` claim, it is listed in the `Token configuration` section but it is
    marked with a warning icon claiming that _"[t]his claim is not supported and will not be returned in the token"_.
    At the time of writing this does not appear to be correct and the claim is in fact returned in the ID token.
</Info>


Hanko per default requires email verification and - with the `xms_edov` claim configured - will reject any attempt at
connecting third party providers that do not provide a verified email address.

## Configure credentials with Hanko

1. In the Hanko Cloud Console, navigate to your project `Settings` and select `Identity providers`.
2. Configure the following:

<Frame>
    <img
        src="/images/oauth-providers/hanko-callback-url.png"
        alt="Hanko Callback URL"
        width={500}
    />
</Frame>

      - **Error Redirect URL**: This is the URL target in your frontend the Hanko API redirects to if an error occurs during third
    party sign-in. If your frontend [uses the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), this URL should be the URL of the
    page that embeds the web component such that errors can be processed properly by the web component.
      - **Allowed Redirect URL**: This is the URL target in your frontend the Hanko API is allowed to redirect to after third party
    authentication was successful. If your frontend [uses the `hanko-elements` web components](#frontend-integration), this URL should be
    the URL of the page that embeds the web component.

        <Note>
        The allowed redirect URL supports wildcard matching through globbing:
         - `https://*.example.com` matches `https://foo.example.com` and `https://bar.example.com`.
         - `https://foo.example.com/*` matches URLs like `https://foo.example.com/page1` and `https://foo.example.com/page2`.
         -  Use ** to act as a super-wildcard/match-all.
        </Note>

2. In the `Providers` section, select `Microsoft` and use the `Enable provider` toggle to enable the provider.
3. Provide the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you obtained in one of the [previous section](#get-your-client-id-and-secret)
in the remaining inputs.
4. Click `Save`.

## Frontend integration

To enable a login with Mircosoft in your frontend application we recommend using either our pre-built UI as
provided by the [`@teamhanko/hanko-elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-elements) package or building a custom UI using
the [`@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk).

<Tabs>

    <Tab title="Hanko Elements">
        We recommend following one of our [quickstart guides](https://docs.hanko.io/quickstarts) to integrate
        the `<hanko-auth>` component from our `@teamhanko/hanko-elements` package in your frontend application .
        On successful integration, the component will display a button for signing in with `Microsoft` in the login view
        of the component.

        <Note>
            Make sure to configure the page the web component is embedded on as your `error redirect URL` as well as an
            `allowed redirect URL` (see the [previous step](#configure-credentials-with-hanko)).
        </Note>

        On successful authentication with the provider, the backend issues a session cookie and the web component
        continues the usual component flow on success. Errors that occur during third party
        provider authentication are also picked up and displayed in the web component accordingly.
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Hanko Frontend SDK">
        When building your own UI, you can use the `@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk` to initialize third party sign in.
        Create a [`Hanko` client](https://teamhanko.github.io/hanko/jsdoc/hanko-frontend-sdk/Client.html) instance and call  the
        `thirdParty.auth` method with `microsoft` as your provider and the target URL in your app you want to redirect
        to after authentication.

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        // you can find the Hanko API URL on the dashboard of your project
        // in the Hanko Cloud Console
        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

        async function signInWithMicrosoft() {
          try {
            // the redirect url argument must be one of the allowed redirect URLs
            // configured in the previous step.
            await hanko.thirdParty.auth("microsoft", "<your_redirect_url>");
          } catch (error) {
            // handle error
          }
        }
        ```

        On successful authentication, the API redirects you to the given redirect URL. The URL query includes a one time
        token that must be exchanged for a JWT. Use the `token.validate` method on your client to validate the token:

        ```js
        import { Hanko } from "@teamhanko/hanko-frontend-sdk";

        const hanko = new Hanko("<your_hanko_api_url>");

            async function onLoad() {
              try {
                await hanko.token.validate();
              } catch (error) {
                // handle error
              }
                // you should now have a JWT cookie set
            }
            ```

            On success, the API issues a JWT which is then set by the SDK as a cookie (hanko). All other SDK methods
            can now use the cookie to make authenticated requests to the API.
