title: User Metadata
---

Hanko allows for defining arbitrary user metadata. Metadata can be categorized into
three types that differ as to how they can be accessed and modified:

| Metadata type | Public API                   | Admin API             |
|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Private       | No read or write access      | Read and write access |
| Public        | Read access                  | Read and write access |
| Unsafe        | Read access and write access | Read and write access |

Each metadata type supports a maximum of 3,000 characters. Metadata is stored as compact JSON (whitespace is ignored).
JSON syntax characters (`{`, `:`, `"`, `}`) count toward the character limit.
Multibyte UTF-8 characters (like emojis or non-Latin characters) count as 1 character each.

## Private metadata

Private metadata should be used for sensitive data that should not be exposed to the client (e.g., internal flags/ids,
configuration, or access control details).

### Accessing private Metadata

Private metadata can be read through the Admin API only using the
[Get metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/get-metadata-of-a-user)
endpoint.

### Setting private metadata

Private metadata can be set and modified through the Admin API only by using the
[Patch metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/patch-metadata-of-a-user) endpoint.

## Public metadata

Public metadata should be used for non-sensitive information that you want accessible but not modifiable by the client
(e.g., certain user roles, UI preferences, display options).

### Accessing public metadata

Public metadata can be read through the Public API, the Admin API and in JWT templates for customizing
the session JWT:

- `Public API`:
    - Public metadata is returned in the `user` object in the payload on the `success` state in a
      [Login](/api-reference/flow/login) and [Registration](/api-reference/flow/registration) flow as well
      as in the payload on the `profile_init` state in a [Profile](/api-reference/flow/profile) flow.
    - Public metadata is returned as part of the response of the
      [Get a user by ID](/api-reference/public/user-management/get-a-user-by-id) endpoint.
- `Admin API`:
    - Public metadata is returned as part of the response of the
      [Get metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/get-metadata-of-a-user)
      endpoint.
    - Public metadata is returned as part of the response of the
      [Get a user by ID](/api-reference/admin/user-management/get-a-user-by-id) endpoint.
- `JWT Templates`:
    - Public metadata can be accessed through the `User` context object available on session JWT customization.
      See [Session token customization](/guides/sessions/session-management#session-token-customization) for more
      details.

### Setting public metadata

Public metadata can be set and modified through the Admin API only by using the
[Patch metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/patch-metadata-of-a-user) endpoint.

## Unsafe metadata

Unsafe metadata should be used for non-sensitive, temporary or experimental data that doesn't need strong safety
guarantees.

### Accessing unsafe metadata

Unsafe metadata can be read through the Public API, the Admin API and in JWT templates for customizing
the session JWT:

- `Public API`:
  - Unsafe metadata is returned in the `user` object in the payload on the `success` state in a `Login` and `Registration` flow as well
    as in the payload on the `profile_init` state in a `Profile` flow.
  - Unsafe metadata is returned as part of the response of the
    [Get a user by ID](/api-reference/public/user-management/get-a-user-by-id) endpoint.
- `Admin API`:
  - Unsafe metadata is returned as part of the response of the
    [Get metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/get-metadata-of-a-user)
    endpoint.
  - Unsafe metadata is returned as part of the response of the
    [Get a user by ID](/api-reference/admin/user-management/get-a-user-by-id) endpoint.
- `JWT Templates`:
  - Unsafe metadata can be accessed through the `User` context object available on session JWT customization.
    See [Session token customization](/guides/sessions/session-management#session-token-customization) for more
    details.


### Setting unsafe metadata

Unsafe metadata can be set and modified through the Public API and the Admin API:

- `Public API`:
    - Unsafe metadata can be set using the `patch_metadata` action in the
      [Profile](/api-reference/flow/profile) flow.

- `Admin API`:
    - Unsafe metadata can be set using the
      [Patch metadata of a user](/api-reference/admin/user-metadata-management/patch-metadata-of-a-user)
        endpoint.
