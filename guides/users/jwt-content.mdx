description: Let's take a quick look at the JWT payload and see what info it holds.
---

#### Example JWT payload:

```json
{
  "aud": [ "https://www.example.com" ],
  "email": {
    "address": "user@example.com",
    "is_primary": true,
    "is_verified": true
  },
  "exp": "17123108000",
  "iat": "1712307200",
  "sub": "9930ac89-1584-488c-bd63-1607f03ab1e8"
}
```

<Note>
  The actual values of the fields in the JWT payload will depend on the specific user and the application. 
  
  It's important to note that the aud (Audience) field is set by the Hanko backend based on the configured values defined when creating a project on the Hanko Cloud.

It contains the following fields:

`aud` (Audience):
    * **Description**: The audience for which the JWT was created. It specifies the intended recipient or system that should accept this JWT.

            `is_primary`:
                * **Description**: A boolean field indicating whether the email address is the primary email. Currently, this field is redundant because only the primary email is included in the JWT.
